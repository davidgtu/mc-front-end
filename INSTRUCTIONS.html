  <h1>ManCrates Frontend Simulation</h1>

  <h2>Before Starting</h2>

  <p>The goals of this exercise are to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>expose you to real problems that you will be expected to solve daily</li>
    <li>follow instructions and build UIs with HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>test your ability to write HTML and CSS according to our guidelines</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You should approach this project as if it was going to go
    into production on a high-traffic website immediately after submission
    where millions of people will see your interfaces on many different devices.
    Indeed, we are interested in seeing what your standard is for a project
    like this as a professional engineer.
  </p>

  <p>
    We expect that, excluding time taken to set up your system and read the documentation, you should be
    able to comfortably complete this exercise in roughly 3-4 hours.
    You should go as fast as you can <u>without sacrificing quality in the submission</u>.
    We would like to get a complete submission even if it takes a
    longer than expected or if you want to work on it in parts. To that
    end you have up to 3 days after receiving the project to finish. As
    a benchmark, our solution took less than 3 hours to complete in a single
    sitting and didn't need to modify any models, controllers or javascript.
  </p>

  <h2>System Requirements & Setup</h2>

  <p>
    This project requires Ruby 2.3.1. To install ruby we recommend using RVM
    (https://rvm.io/rvm/install). One you have RVM installed you can run: </p>

  <!-- @formatter:off -->
  <pre><code>rvm install ruby-2.3.1</code></pre>
  <!-- @formatter:on -->


  <p>After ruby is installed, change into the project's root directory and install all dependencies:</p>

  <!-- @formatter:off -->
  <pre><code>bundle install</code></pre>
  <!-- @formatter:on -->

  <p>(If you had trouble with on that step, <a href="#troubleshooting">try this workaround</a>*.)</p>

  <p> After all the dependencies have been installed you should be able to start the server.
    Everything should already be setup and all you should need to do is run </p>

  <!-- @formatter:off -->
  <pre><code>rails server</code></pre>
  <!-- @formatter:on -->

  <p> If you navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> you should see the
    page you will see our home page. From the home page you can navigate to our categories page
    <a href="http://localhost:3000/categories/1">http://localhost:3000/categories/1</a>. This will be the page
    you are going to implement.
  </p>


  <p>Finally since we have removed the root git repository from the app your final task should be to
    initialize
    one and make your first commit.</p>

  <!-- @formatter:off -->
  <pre><code>git init; git add .; git commit</code></pre>
  <!-- @formatter:on -->

  <p>At this point you should be good to go! If you run into any issues getting set up, please let us know
    ASAP.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>
    The year is 3031, the president of the United States is a man by the name of Burt Herbert and ManCrates
    is one of the largest companies on the planet. Incredibly ManCrates was able lobby congress into
    creating a law mandating that marriage licenses would only be given out if both parties exchanged a
    ManCrates gift instead of rings (or other items). Obviously countries around the world followed suit,
    orders skyrocketed, and now we need your help building out the new and improved UIs for ManCrates!
  </p>

  <h2>References</h2>

  <h3>Documentation: Frontend.md</h3>
  <p>
    Included under <span><code>docs/FRONTEND.md</code></span> we have included a intro to the way ManCrates
    organizes, implements and composes CSS and HTML. You should absolutely read it before getting started. If
    you are a bit weak with CSS there is also a quick link to a website that goes over the fundamentals
    of CSS layouts. Otherwise the only other documentation you will need will be the
    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">bootstrap V3 docs</a> and perhaps the rails
    <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html" target="_blank">view helper documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Implementation: Home Page</h3>
  <p>
    We realize that most of the time when developing a project you will have a set of examples to
    pull and learn from that follow the guides. To that end we have included a version of our homepage that
    is styled, responsive, and sets an example for what you should be shooting for.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> you will be able to see it. The
    relevant styles for that page live
    <span><code>app/assets/stylesheets/store/views/pages/home.scss</code></span>
    and the html lives <span><code>app/views/store/pages/home.html.erb</code></span>. As you can see the
    CSS and the HTML have almost identical paths (this is on purpose).
  </p>

  <p>
    If you open up the home.scss file you will immediately see components that are organized together with
    comment tags such as <span><code>// -- Product Formats --</code></span>. You should strive
    for a similar level of organization for your final css in your submission.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will also notice, just as our FRONTEND.md file mentions, that we break our components into class tags,
    give semantic names with minimal parent selectors</a>, no <span><code>!important</code></span> calls, and
    grouped media queries. We will be grading you on how well you can apply those guidelines to your own
    work as well.
  </p>

  <h2>Grading Criteria</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Visual:</b> Mocks and implementation look exactly alike</li>
    <li><b>Responsive:</b> Supports mobile and desktop beautifully</li>
    <li><b>CrossBrowser support:</b> Chrome, and Firefox (latest) -- Don't worry about IE</li>
    <li><b>Style:</b> How well you followed our style guide and reference implementation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> Timing will not be part of the grading criteria but will be required with your submission. If
    you are invited back for a team interview there will be a coding exercise and the time given
    will be proportional to what you reported for the assignment.
  </p>

  <h2>Before Starting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Take a read of FRONTEND.md and the homepage implementation</li>
    <li>Start a timer! Record how long it takes you to do the assignment and include it with your submission</li>
    <li>If you have questions you can email tim@mancrates.com</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Assignment: The Category Page</h2>

  <p>Your task in this simulation is to add HTML & ERB to
    <span><code>app/views/store/categories/show.html.erb</code></span> and CSS to
    <span><code>app/assets/stylesheets/store/views/categories/show.scss</code></span>. (Again no JS should
    be used in the simulation) and very little ruby should be used (<b>absolutely no models or controllers should be
    built </b>, just view helpers like <span><code>image_tag</code></span> when needed). You can get an idea of
    what view helpers might be needed from the home.html.erb file.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have already done the layout (header, footer, etc) for you so you are not responsible for those parts.
  </p>

  <p>The mocks you should use as your UI guide can be found under <span><code>mocks/</code></span>. To give
    you an idea here is the desktop version:</p>

  <img src="mocks/Category-Desktop.png">

  <p>You will need to do both desktop and mobile. Full size versions are in
  <a href="mocks">the mocks directory</a>. You can fill in the text descriptions using
  <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/"> Lorum Ipsum </a> for speed</p>

  <p>We have also included a couple example products and their images. You can find them in
    <span><code>app/assets/images/store/products</code></span>. Feel free to use those for the images. You
    can repeat them as necessary to file up the page with at least 12 products.
  </p>

  <p>Since we are not allowing JS here none of the interaction here has to work, it just needs to look
    exactly like the mocks using HTML, CSS and Rails view helpers.</p>


  <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting installing nokogiri</h2>
  <p>Some environments won't run bundle install completely without a hitch the first time. If you get errors, try this:</p>
  <!-- @formatter:off -->
  <pre><code>brew uninstall xz</code></pre>
  <pre><code>gem install nokogiri -v 1.6.8</code></pre>
  <pre><code>bundle install</code></pre>
  <!-- @formatter:on -->

  <p>

    and also <a href="http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html#mac_os_x">nokogiri's docs</a> on installation.)
